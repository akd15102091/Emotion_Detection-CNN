# Emotion_Detection-CNN

In this project, We **predict the Emotion** using **CNN deep learning technique** and **Opencv** .

images/train => there are 7 folders containing around total 28000 images

images/test => there are 7 folders containing around total 7000 images

["angry","disgust", "fear", "happy", "neutral", "sad", "surprise"] - 7 types of emotions (7 folders)

The model has been trained over these images.

Used **Transfer Learning (InceptionV3) technique** also along with normal CNN model.

Also tried to optimize the CNN model.

Libraries used in this project :

    1) OS, Numpy, Random, Matplotlib

    2) Tensorflow (keras)
    
    3) Opencv-python
